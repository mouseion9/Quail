\headerbox{DOSLICES}{}{QUAIL-KERNEL::MACRO}
 
{\bf Description}

Provides straightforward iteration over selected slices of a refable object. Syntax: ( doslices ( slice-var object slices \{[return-form] \| [order]\} ) \{form\}* ) First doslices evaluates the form object, which should produce a refable object. It then executes the body once for each slice in the object as determined by slices. The order of iteration is determined by the optional argument order: either :row ( the default ) for row major order, or :col for column major order. The variable slice-var is bound to the slice. Then, return-form is evaluated and the result is the value of the doslices form. ( When the return-form is evaluated, the control variable slice-var is still bound and has the value NIL. ) If return-form is omitted, the result is NIL. If slices is omitted, looping is over each element of the object.
