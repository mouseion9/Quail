Models examples
---------------

The examples in this folder concern Generalized Linear Models, using
the function glm.  For the Gaussian Linear Model, you may use the function lm,
which defaults to the gaussian family.

Some of these examples are quite large and may take a while to execute
on smaller configurations.  They will, however, at least illustrate the
syntax of model formulae etc.

binary/logit:       eg-glm-kyphosis.lisp
poisson/log:        eg-glm-ship.lisp
gamma/reciprocal:   eg-glm-cars.lisp

Restrictions and Caveats
------------------------

--  The fitting code has not yet been exercised extensively.

--  The data types are not well developed at all, so manipulation can
    be a bit cumbersome right now.

--  Fitting of Generalized Additive Models is not yet implemented.

--  The degrees of freedom computations work fine in nice cases, but can
    break currently if there are structural zeros.

--  The generic function residuals is largely untested.

--  Summaries, plots, and model searching aren't there.
