
Aside from that, there are some small mods in the functions for
dragging rectangles, new function for reshaping a rectangle,
a fix for canvas set pen (ypu may have caught this by now)
Also, I have added functions for drawing arcs. This I needed
for the new view type "pie" as in piecharts. These may be used
as multi-color glyphs in place of symbols in a pointcloud.
