Hi Wayne --

I think this is how it will go.  Things are a little bit strange because of an
inconsistency about where files live, but we can manage for the moment.

In ffenv-libs-mcl.lisp,  remove all of the "-mc68881" strings wherever
they appear, and reload the file.  Also eval the ffenvs-create-compile 
function.

In quail-path.lisp, *change* (not comment out !) occurrences
of "FPU" and "881" to null string in the *standard-libraries-table*, 
and evaluate the relevant stuff.  (Might want to make a copy of these
lines and comment them out, first, though.)

Copy the files q:source;quaff;c programs;types.c and types-mcl.c to
the directory q:foreign;quaff.

Then, I guess, do the following:

(qk::ffenvs-create-compile (directory "q:foreign;quaff;*.c")
                           :c
                           "q:foreign;quaff;fundamental-compile.mpw")

(qk::ffenvs-create-compile (directory "q:foreign;linpack;*.f")
                           :fortran
                           "q:foreign;linpack;linpack-compile.mpw")

(qk::standardize-foreign-environments NIL NIL NIL T)

Boot up MPW, open q:foreign;quaff;fundamental-compile.mpw and eval its
contents.  Then do q:foreign;linpack;linpack-compile.mpw.

After these two, open q:foreign;ffenv-libs;standard-quail-ffenvs.make,
and eval its contents.

It's probably best, at this point, to reboot Quail and see if everything
goes OK.  Not sure that a problem would be detectable, though.  Might want
to ask Arthur if he knows of an FPU-less '040 hooked up to MacJanet that
we might test this on.

Might want to stash this doc file in the Foreign directory somewhere.
                                      
It's a bit of a trick for me to get at MPW, so this is untested.  If you
have trouble, let me know, though, 'cuz I *could* do it at this end if
need be.

Please let me know how it turns out ...

Greg
